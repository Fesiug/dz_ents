# Danger Zone Entities
Working entities from CS:GO's Danger Zone (as well as other modes) to spice up your Garry's Mod sessions.

## Features

### Weapon Cases
9 breakable cases that drop loot, including 3 unused ones. The loot tables are dynamically generated based on the weapons you have installed!

Reinforced cases can't be broken with fists.

### Armor + Helmet
Equip these to change the way armor calculation works to be like CS:GO. If you use an accurate CS:GO weapon port, you will get identical damage values as the real game!

### Heavy Assault Suit
Featured in Operation Wildfire and later Co-op Strike, this heavy armor gives you significantly increased protection. Armor calculation is also accurate to the original operation.

Equipping these slows you down significantly, and the weight can be detrimental should you fall from a high place.

### ExoJump
Equipping these allows you to jump higher while holding down the jump key. Crouch jumping also boosts you forward. They also reduce your fall damage.

### Bump Mines
Perhaps the most iconic mobility tool from Danger Zone, these mines can launch yourself or others into the air when triggered. When launched, players and even NPCs will take damage if they crash into a wall or take a long fall.

### Parachute
Deploy this to slow your fall. You'll get to see the straps and letterboxing just like CS:GO!

### Medi-Shot
Restores your health over time, and grants you a brief speed boost. You can also configure it to modify the amount of damage you take or deal.

### Ammo Box
A variety of boxes to load your guns with. For CS:GO weapons, ammo pickup values will be the same as Danger Zone, or you can make them restore per-clip like in Co-op Strike.

## Integration

### Weapon Case Autodetection
All weapons should appear in the correct case category based on autodetection.

### CS:GO Weapon Integration
If an addon is using CS:GO weapons, they will get the correct armor penetration and ammo pick up values.

The following addons have integration:
- **[SWCS CS:GO Weapons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2193997180)**. **Recommended.** Accurate port with correct names and values.
- **[RetroSource's CS:GO Weapons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2180833718)**
- **[ArcCW Gunsmith Offensive](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2131057232)**, as well as the [Extras](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2409364730) pack by yours truly.
- **[ARC9 Gunsmith Reloaded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2910537020)**
- [TFA CS:GO](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2839918331). Original is long gone, so the link is the most popular reupload.
