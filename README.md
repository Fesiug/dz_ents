# Danger Zone Entities
Working entities from CS:GO's Danger Zone (as well as other modes) to spice up your Garry's Mod sessions.

## Integration

### Weapon Case Autodetection
All weapons should appear in the correct case category based on autodetection.

### CS:GO Weapon Integration
If an addon is using CS:GO weapons, they will get the correct armor penetration and ammo pick up values.

The following addons have integration:
- **[SWCS CS:GO Weapons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2193997180)**. **Recommended.** Accurate port with correct names and values.
- **[RetroSource's CS:GO Weapons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2180833718)**
- **[ArcCW Gunsmith Offensive](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2131057232)**, as well as the [Extras](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2409364730) pack by yours truly.
- **[ARC9 Gunsmith Reloaded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2910537020)**
- [TFA CS:GO](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2839918331). Original is long gone, so the link is the most popular reupload.
- [This set of CSGO weapons from 2017](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1254322322)
